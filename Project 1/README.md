## Development Journal

### Session 1 

* Added a patch that plays two chords. 'A' button switches between the two chords, 'X' button triggers playback on/off, and pitch data from the gyro sensor modulates pitch bend.
* Want to add: chord inversions using joysticks, design an instrument in ableton that will work well with repeating, long chords -  ambient soundscape.
