# ÂµTide - Project Proposal

My idea for an instrument would be a structure that drops droplets of water in a semi-controlled way onto a surface or various surfaces like metal tines/tuning forks, stone, wood etc.

Each of teh surfaces will have a contact mic, and the signal will be used to create the sounds of the instrument. Depending on the raw signal, it will be processed significantly or more subtly. 

I imagine the instrument to produce an ambient, textural soundscape.

For the droplet system, I would imagine using either a peristaltic pump, or possibly an IV bag with the line opening or closing using a solenoid.

### Good outcome:
- At least one surface with a contact microphone, signal processed in max, simple water dropping system.

### Better outcome:
- Two or more surfaces, separate water line that can be opened/closed to create an arrangement of sounds coming in and out. 

### Best outcome:
- Multiple surfaces, all with separate microphones, sound processing, and the possibility of turning them on/off independetly. Advanced signal processing allowing for various textures and sounds, some melodic, some percussive.
