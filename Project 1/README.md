# Project 1

Nintendo Switch Controller instrument.

## Development Journal

### Session 1 

* Added a patch that plays two chords. 'A' button switches between the two chords, 'X' button triggers playback on/off, and pitch data from the gyro sensor modulates pitch bend.
* Want to add: chord inversions using joysticks, design an instrument in ableton that will work well with repeating, long chords -  ambient soundscape.

### Session 2

* Added the ableton patch with a simple pad, and a drum loop loaded up.
* Added EQ control on the X axis of the left joystick as well as reverb mix on the Y axis.
* Added triggering the drum loop on and off with up and down buttons. Sometimes you have to press them down twice due to the way they trigger, not sure how to fix that for now.
* Want to add controlable drum effects.
